## Prompt

/sp.constitution

Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Full Book for Docusaurus (SpecKit Plus + Claude Code)

Mission:
Create a complete, professionally structured, academically accurate, production-ready book that teaches Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, Embodied Intelligence, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA (Vision-Language-Action), and Sim-to-Real deployment. The book will be generated using Spec-Kit Plus automation and written collaboratively through Claude Code.

Core Principles:
- Accuracy: Every technical concept—ROS 2, Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Unity, VLA—must follow official documentation + engineering best practices.
- Clarity: Book must be understandable by intermediate AI/robotics students.
- Hierarchy: Each chapter structured with clear sections, subsections, and code blocks.
- Repeatability: All tutorials must be fully reproducible on Linux/Ubuntu (22.04), cloud rigs, or Jetson kits.
- Real-World Rigor: Everything must connect to real humanoid robotics workflows—simulation, control, perception, locomotion, VSLAM, manipulation.
- Consistency: Entire book must follow one unified writing tone, formatting style, glossary, and cross-referencing structure.

Book Standards:
- Format: Docusaurus site with autogenerated sidebars + pages.
- Writing Style: Technical, clear, step-by-step, visual-first.
- Code Formatting: Python, ROS 2 launch files, URDF, Unity setup, Isaac Sim scripts.
- Visuals: Include diagrams (ASCII or placeholders for images).
- AI Use: Allow Claude subagents for reusable intelligence (skills for ROS 2, Isaac, robotics math, etc.).

Scope (Full Topics Included):
1. Physical AI Foundations
2. Embodied Intelligence
3. Physical World Constraints (gravity, friction, sensors)
4. Humanoid robotics landscape
5. ROS 2 Fundamentals (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions)
6. URDF/SDF for humanoids
7. Simulation with Gazebo
8. Environment building in Unity
9. NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, Navigation - Nav2)
10. Vision-Language-Action Systems
11. Whisper for voice → action
12. Planning with LLMs
13. Humanoid locomotion, balance, gait
14. Manipulation & grasping
15. Human–robot interaction
16. Conversational robotics
17. Cloud simulation workflows
18. On-prem home lab build
19. Edge deployment on Jetson
20. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

Weekly Breakdown Requirements:
- Weeks 1–2: Physical AI fundamentals
- Weeks 3–5: ROS 2
- Weeks 6–7: Gazebo simulation
- Weeks 8–10: NVIDIA Isaac
- Weeks 11–12: Humanoid development
- Week 13: Conversational robotics

Hardware Requirements:
Include detailed chapters covering:
- Digital Twin Workstation (RTX 4070 Ti → RTX 4090)
- Jetson Orin AI Kit
- RealSense cameras
- IMU + Microphone arrays
- Robot tiers: Unitree Go2 → Unitree G1 → Low-cost alternatives
- Cloud rigs (AWS g5/g6e)

Constraints:
- Every chapter must be generated inside `/docs` with correct sidebar JSON entries.
- No hallucinated features—everything must reference real APIs (ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Isaac Sim, etc.)
- All tutorials must run on Ubuntu 22.04 or cloud AMI images.
- Where hardware is required, include simulation-only fallbacks.
- Images/media stored in `/static`.

Success Criteria:
- Complete Docusaurus book with 20–40 chapters.
- All modules written with depth suitable for capstone-level robotics.
- Full reproducibility check passes for ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim examples.
- Logical progression from theory → simulation → real-world → humanoid robotics.
- A full Capstone chapter describing an autonomous humanoid that:
  1. Accepts a voice command (Whisper)
  2. Converts it to an action plan (LLM)
  3. Navigates using Nav2
  4. Uses CV to find objects
  5. Manipulates objects using controllers
- Book deploys to GitHub Pages using `/sp.deploy`.
- Reusable Intelligence Enabled: Claude Code Subagents + Agent Skills for robotics, ROS 2, VLA, etc.

Automation Rules for SpecKit + Claude:
- Use `/sp.plan` to generate the entire plan for book creation.
- Use `/sp.implement` one chapter at a time.
- Every chapter must automatically:
  - Create new MDX file
  - Add sidebar entry
  - Include intro, theory, code, diagrams, exercises
- Subagents may be activated for:
  - ROS 2 expertise
  - Isaac simulation
  - Humanoid kinematics
  - VLA planning flows
  - Robotics math calculations
- Enforce quality gates before finalizing any chapter.

Output Format:
- Docusaurus MDX pages
- Code blocks (Python, XML, URDF, Launch files)
- Diagrams
- Glossary pages
- Lab instructions
- Project templates
- GitHub-ready structure

Final Book Deliverables:
- Full multi-module robotics book
- Professional documentation site
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Capstone implementation guide
- Complete simulation + real-world stack

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution (v1.0.0) at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

The constitution establishes seven core principles:
1. **Accuracy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: All technical content must follow official documentation and be reproducible
2. **Clarity and Accessibility**: Content understandable by intermediate AI/robotics students
3. **Hierarchical Organization**: Consistent chapter structure with proper heading hierarchy
4. **Reproducibility**: All tutorials executable on Ubuntu 22.04, cloud rigs, or Jetson kits
5. **Real-World Rigor**: All concepts connected to actual humanoid robotics workflows
6. **Consistency Across Book**: Unified writing tone, formatting, glossary, and cross-referencing
7. **Automation-First Development**: All chapters generated through SpecKit Plus automation

Technical standards defined:
- Platform requirements (Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble/Iron, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac Sim)
- Code quality standards (PEP 8, ROS 2 C++ Style Guide, error handling, testing)
- Documentation standards (intro, theory, code examples, diagrams, exercises, glossary)
- Media/asset organization (`/static/img/`, `/static/code/`, `/static/data/`)

Development workflow established:
- Chapter creation process: Planning → Task breakdown → Implementation → Quality gates → Integration
- Incremental development strategy following 13-week curriculum
- Subagent activation for specialized expertise (ROS 2, Isaac Sim, humanoid kinematics, VLA, robotics math)

Scope clearly defined:
- **In Scope**: 20 comprehensive topics from Physical AI foundations through capstone project
- **Out of Scope**: Low-level firmware, PCB design, manufacturing, ROS 1, production-scale DevOps
- **Success Criteria**: 20-40 chapters, all quality gates passed, full capstone documented, GitHub Pages deployment

Governance framework:
- Amendment process with semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Compliance review requirements
- Separation of WHAT (constitution) vs HOW (CLAUDE.md)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution ratified v1.0.0 - establishes foundational governance for entire Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book development
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (constitution document - no code tests required)
- 📁 Files: Created/updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with complete principles, standards, workflow, scope, and governance
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.specify` (create first feature/chapter specification), `/sp.plan` (generate book structure plan), or direct chapter planning
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures the ambitious scope of a production-grade robotics textbook while maintaining strict quality standards for technical accuracy, reproducibility, and pedagogical clarity

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution creation completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All template placeholders replaced, no unexplained tokens, version/dates coherent, principles declarative and testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial constitution)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin book structure planning with `/sp.plan` or create first chapter specification with `/sp.specify`
