# Overview of Humanoid Robotics Systems

## Introduction

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and function like humans, enabling them to navigate human-designed environments and interact naturally with people.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand humanoid robot design principles
- Explore key subsystems (locomotion, manipulation, perception)
- Survey current humanoid robot platforms

## Theory

### Why Humanoid Form?

1. **Environment Compatibility**: Human spaces (stairs, doors, furniture)
2. **Natural Interaction**: Familiar form for human-robot collaboration
3. **Versatility**: Multi-purpose capabilities
4. **Research Platform**: Study human movement and cognition

### Key Subsystems

**Locomotion**
- Bipedal walking
- Balance control
- Gait generation
- Terrain adaptation

**Manipulation**
- Dexterous hands
- Arm kinematics
- Grasp planning
- Tool use

**Perception**
- Vision systems
- Tactile sensing
- Proprioception
- Audio processing

**Cognition**
- Motion planning
- Task reasoning
- Human interaction
- Learning capabilities

## Current Platforms

- **Atlas** (Boston Dynamics): Athletic humanoid
- **Optimus** (Tesla): General-purpose assistant
- **ASIMO** (Honda): Pioneer in humanoid research
- **Figure 01**: Commercial humanoid for warehouses
- **Digit** (Agility Robotics): Logistics robot

## Exercises

1. Research one humanoid robot platform
2. Why might a wheeled robot be preferable to a humanoid?
3. Sketch subsystems needed for a humanoid to make coffee

## Summary

Humanoid robots combine bipedal locomotion, dexterous manipulation, and advanced perception to operate in human environments.
