# The Physical AI System Architecture

## Introduction

A Physical AI system integrates multiple components into a cohesive architecture that enables intelligent physical behavior.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the canonical robotics architecture
- Explore the sense-plan-act loop
- Identify integration challenges

## Theory

### Sense-Plan-Act Architecture

```
┌─────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│ SENSING │ --> │ PLANNING │ --> │ ACTING  │
└─────────┘     └──────────┘     └─────────┘
     ^                                  |
     └──────────── Feedback ────────────┘
```

### Layer Breakdown

**1. Sensing Layer**
- Cameras (RGB, depth, stereo)
- LiDAR and range sensors
- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
- Force/torque sensors
- Tactile sensors
- Audio microphones

**2. Perception Layer**
- Object detection & tracking
- Semantic segmentation
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Pose estimation
- Scene understanding

**3. Planning Layer**
- Path planning
- Motion planning
- Task planning
- Grasp planning
- High-level reasoning (LLM integration)

**4. Control Layer**
- Motor controllers
- Balance controllers
- Trajectory following
- Compliance control

**5. Actuation Layer**
- Motors (servos, stepper, brushless)
- Grippers and hands
- Wheels/legs
- Tool interfaces

## System Integration

### ROS 2 as Middleware
- Node-based architecture
- Message passing
- Service calls
- Action servers
- Parameter management

### Real-Time Considerations
- Control loops: 100-1000 Hz
- Perception: 10-60 Hz
- Planning: 1-10 Hz
- High-level reasoning: 0.1-1 Hz

## Exercises

1. Draw a sense-plan-act diagram for a robot vacuum
2. What happens if sensing fails? Planning fails?
3. Why do different subsystems run at different frequencies?

## Summary

Physical AI architectures integrate sensing, perception, planning, control, and actuation into real-time systems that enable robots to operate in the physical world.
