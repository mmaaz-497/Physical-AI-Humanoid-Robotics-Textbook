# Embodied Intelligence & Real-World Agents

## Introduction

Embodied intelligence explores how physical presence shapes intelligence, cognition, and learning in robotic systems.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Define embodied intelligence
- Understand the role of physical interaction in learning
- Explore agent-environment coupling

## Theory

Embodied intelligence posits that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, brain, and environment. Unlike disembodied AI, embodied agents:
- Learn through sensorimotor experiences
- Develop situated understanding
- Adapt to physical constraints

### The Embodiment Hypothesis

Physical bodies are not just containers for intelligence - they actively shape how intelligence develops and functions.

## Real-World Agents

Characteristics of embodied agents:
- **Morphology**: Physical structure influences behavior
- **Situatedness**: Embedded in specific environments
- **Autonomy**: Self-directed action
- **Adaptability**: Learning from physical feedback

## Exercises

1. How does physical embodiment change learning strategies?
2. Describe how a robot's shape affects its capabilities
3. Compare human embodied learning to robot learning

## Summary

Embodied intelligence emphasizes that intelligence is not purely computational but emerges from physical interaction with the world.
