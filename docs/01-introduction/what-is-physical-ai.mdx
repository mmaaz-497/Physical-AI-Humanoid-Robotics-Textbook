# What Is Physical AI?

## Introduction

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from purely digital artificial intelligence to AI systems that interact with and understand the physical world. This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI and its significance in modern robotics.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the definition and scope of Physical AI
- Identify key differences from traditional AI systems
- Recognize real-world applications of Physical AI

## Theory

Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with physical embodiment, enabling machines to:
- Perceive the environment through sensors
- Make decisions based on real-world data
- Act on the environment through actuators
- Learn from physical interactions

### Key Characteristics

1. **Embodiment**: Physical presence in the world
2. **Perception**: Multi-modal sensing (vision, touch, audio)
3. **Action**: Ability to manipulate and navigate
4. **Learning**: Continuous adaptation from experience

## Practical Examples

Physical AI is deployed in:
- Autonomous vehicles
- Manufacturing robots
- Healthcare assistants
- Warehouse automation
- Humanoid robots

## Exercises

1. List three examples of Physical AI in your daily life
2. Compare digital AI (e.g., ChatGPT) vs Physical AI (e.g., robot vacuum)
3. Identify sensors a humanoid robot might need

## Summary

Physical AI bridges the gap between digital intelligence and physical reality, enabling robots to interact meaningfully with the world around them.
