# Synthetic Data Generation

## Introduction

Synthetic data generation in Isaac Sim enables automated creation of labeled datasets for training perception models without manual annotation. This accelerates computer vision development for robotics applications.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Generate synthetic images with automatic labels
- Implement domain randomization techniques
- Export datasets in standard formats (COCO, YOLO)
- Train perception models on synthetic data

## Theory

### Benefits of Synthetic Data

**Advantages:**
- **Auto-labeling**: Bounding boxes, segmentation masks generated automatically
- **Scalability**: Generate thousands of images per hour
- **Diversity**: Cover edge cases impossible to capture in real world
- **Cost-effective**: No manual annotation labor

### Domain Randomization

Vary simulation parameters to improve model generalization:
- Lighting conditions
- Textures and materials
- Object poses and configurations
- Camera angles and parameters

## Summary

Synthetic data generation with Isaac Sim provides automated, scalable dataset creation for training robust perception models through domain randomization and automatic annotation.
