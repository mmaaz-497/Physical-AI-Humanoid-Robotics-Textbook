# Sim-to-Real Deployment

## Introduction

Sim-to-real deployment bridges simulation and physical robots, enabling algorithms developed in Isaac Sim to work on real hardware through careful gap mitigation strategies.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the reality gap challenge
- Apply domain randomization for robust transfer
- Deploy Isaac ROS to Jetson edge devices
- Validate and tune real-world performance

## Theory

### The Reality Gap

**Definition**: Discrepancy between simulated and real-world behavior

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Domain Randomization**: Vary simulation parameters
2. **Sensor Noise Modeling**: Add realistic noise in sim
3. **System Identification**: Measure real robot parameters
4. **Progressive Deployment**: Test incrementally

## Deployment Workflow

```
Isaac Sim Development → Testing → Jetson Deployment → Validation
```

## Summary

Successful sim-to-real deployment requires domain randomization, careful calibration, and systematic validation. Isaac ROS on Jetson enables seamless transition from simulation to real-world deployment.
