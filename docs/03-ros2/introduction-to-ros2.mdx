# Introduction to Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Introduction

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is an open-source middleware framework that provides the communication backbone for robotics applications. Think of it as the nervous system that connects sensors, controllers, and actuators in a robot.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what ROS 2 is and why it's used
- Learn the core architecture concepts
- Install and verify ROS 2 Humble
- Run your first ROS 2 nodes

## What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is NOT an operating system but a **middleware** that runs on top of Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended). It provides:

- **Communication infrastructure**: Nodes talk via topics, services, and actions
- **Hardware abstraction**: Same code works on different robots
- **Tools**: Visualization (RViz), simulation (Gazebo), debugging
- **Packages**: Reusable libraries for navigation, perception, manipulation

### Key Improvements Over ROS 1

- **Real-time support**: Deterministic communication for safety-critical systems
- **Security**: Encrypted and authenticated communication
- **Multi-robot**: Native support for robot swarms
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, macOS

## Core Concepts

### Nodes
Independent processes that perform specific tasks (e.g., camera driver, path planner).

### Topics
Asynchronous publish-subscribe channels for streaming data (e.g., sensor readings).

### Services
Synchronous request-response patterns (e.g., "calculate path from A to B").

### Actions
Long-running tasks with feedback (e.g., "navigate to goal, send progress updates").

## Installation (Ubuntu 22.04)

```bash
# Add ROS 2 repository
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

# Install ROS 2 Humble Desktop
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop -y

# Source ROS 2 environment
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Verification

Test your installation:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run a talker node
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

# Terminal 2: Run a listener node
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
```

You should see the listener receiving messages from the talker.

## ROS 2 CLI Tools

```bash
# List running nodes
ros2 node list

# List active topics
ros2 topic list

# See topic messages
ros2 topic echo /chatter

# Get node info
ros2 node info /talker
```

## Exercises

1. Install ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04
2. Run the talker/listener demo
3. Use `ros2 topic echo` to view messages
4. Explore available ROS 2 packages with `ros2 pkg list`

## Summary

ROS 2 is the communication middleware that enables modular, distributed robotics systems. It provides nodes, topics, services, and actions as building blocks for robot software.
