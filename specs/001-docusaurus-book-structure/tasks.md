# Tasks: Docusaurus Book Structure for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-docusaurus-book-structure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No automated tests specified in feature specification. Manual validation scenarios provided in quickstart.md.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Docusaurus project**: Repository root
- **Chapter files**: `docs/{category-dir}/{chapter-slug}.mdx`
- **Static assets**: `static/img/`, `static/code/`, `static/data/`
- **Configuration**: `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`, `package.json`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6 → P7 → P8)
- **Polish (Phase 11)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (builds on US1 navigation but independently testable)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (logically builds on US4 ROS 2 knowledge, but independently testable)
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (logically builds on US4/US5, but independently testable)
- **User Story 7 (P7)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies (capstone integration, but independently testable)
- **User Story 8 (P8)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies

### Within Each User Story

- All MDX file creation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Asset creation (images, code examples) marked [P] can run in parallel
- Testing and validation tasks depend on content completion

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Tasks T003-T007 can run in parallel after T001-T002
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Tasks T009-T022 can run in parallel, T024-T026 can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Tasks T029-T063 (all placeholder MDX files) can run in parallel
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Tasks T068-T072 (content writing) can run in parallel, T073-T074 (diagrams) can run in parallel
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Tasks T078-T080 (setup guides) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Tasks T084-T088 (chapter content) can run in parallel, T089-T094 (code/data files) can run in parallel
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: Tasks T097-T101 (chapters) can run in parallel, T102-T105 (assets) can run in parallel
- **Phase 8 (US6)**: Tasks T108-T113 (chapters) can run in parallel, T114-T117 (code/diagrams) can run in parallel
- **Phase 9 (US7)**: Tasks T120-T126 (chapters) can run in parallel, T127-T131 (code/diagrams) can run in parallel
- **Phase 10 (US8)**: Tasks T133-T136 (reference chapters) can run in parallel
- **Phase 11 (Polish)**: Tasks T139-T142 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Navigation MVP with all 36 placeholder chapters)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test sidebar navigation, verify 7 categories, test responsiveness
5. Deploy MVP if ready

**MVP Scope**: 150 tasks total through Phase 3 (T001-T067)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (MVP) → Test independently → Deploy (Navigation working!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Introduction content) → Test independently → Deploy
4. Add User Story 3 (Setup guides) → Test independently → Deploy
5. Add User Story 4 (ROS 2 tutorials) → Test independently → Deploy
6. Add User Story 5 (Digital Twin) → Test independently → Deploy
7. Add User Story 6 (NVIDIA Isaac) → Test independently → Deploy
8. Add User Story 7 (VLA & Humanoids) → Test independently → Deploy
9. Add User Story 8 (References) → Test independently → Deploy
10. Complete Polish → Final deployment

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers/content creators:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (navigation MVP)
   - Content Writer B: User Story 2 (introduction chapters)
   - Content Writer C: User Story 3 (setup guides)
   - Content Writer D: User Story 4 (ROS 2 content)
   - Etc.
3. Each story completes and integrates independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No automated tests specified - manual validation per quickstart.md
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All tasks include exact file paths for clarity
- Constitution compliance validated throughout (especially Principles I-VII)
